Ludum Dare #33 compo

This was my submission for Ludum Dare 33. Theme: You are the monster.

For the post-compo version, see [LD33/master](https://github.com/scriptorum/LD33/tree/master).

## Stuff that didn't make it into the compo version
- Rubble smoke/demo/rubble-toss effect
- Foot pounding
- "Stay put" rubble effects
- Flap sound, flap puff dust, running sound
- Shading on monster art
- Tree parallax
- Villagers escaping buildings/running from you
- Sun lowers/Sunset as difficulty rise
- Tutorial tips to explain the game as you run
- Test variant pike rules (for a variation of max speeds)
- Better indicators of whether you're going fast/slow enough to deal with obstacles
- Clearer and animated pikes
- Additional input control (spacebar to start, click to flap)
- Test variant slowdown as a percentage of total speed to be more Flappy like
- Music? What music?
- A moving lawn would be nice

## To Do
- Create a postcompo branch
- Examine Threadbare preloader which just showed at 0% in practice
- Do some barebones audio testing to figure out why the first sound played always comes at a delay

## Build Notes
- Export Spriter files with a custom rect of -80,-70,60,30 to make all the cells 141x101. I had a hard time working with this tool!
